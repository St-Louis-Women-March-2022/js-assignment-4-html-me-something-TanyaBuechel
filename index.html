               <h2>Welcome to Fourth Grade Science!</h2>
               <p>In this class, students are given the opportunity to do hands-on exploration of science concepts that help broaden their understanding of the world.
                  Students are encouraged to ask questions, make mistakes, and investigate as they engage in the learning process.
                  By the end of the school year, students become expert scientists!</p>

               <img src="images/About Me.png"/>
               <p>My name is Tanya Buechel and I have been teaching fourth grade science for three years.
                  I graduated from Southern Illinois University with a degree in Elementary Education with science, social science, and language arts endorsements.
                  I live in Troy, Illinois with my family. I have two children, Nathan and Nolan, and a dog named Lemmy.</p>

               <h2>Class Structure</h2>
               <p>A typical day in class begins with a vocabulary review over science terms. 
                  Each student has a science binder inside of the classroom, where they keep their Science Journal. The Science Journals contain student research over the concept we are learning.
                  Each science topic is broken down into many different lessons that follow the 5E instructional model (Engage, Explore, Explain, Elaborate, Evaluate).
                  In fourth grade, students are introduce to writing CERs (Claim, Evidence, Reasoning). CERs are scienific explanations that are backed up by sound evidence that the students have collected.</p>
